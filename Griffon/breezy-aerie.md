# Breezy Aerie

A massive (25' diameter) nest rests at the edge of a cliff.
The nest is smeared in **blood** and contains 3 golden-hued **eggs**, marbled with bronze.
Guarding the eggs are 3 _Griffons_ (MM169). Strewn about the nest are hundreds of
**electrum** and an **amber bow**.

- **Blood**: From horses; a Griffon's favorite meal.
- **Eggs**: Baby Griffons. 3/6 st each. Worth 1785g each.
- **Electrum**: 1000 coins in total. Dented. The griffons love the mouth-feel.
- **Amber Bow**: Long Bow +2. Made from wood the color of amber, with a sky-blue leather grip.
  Strung with celestial silk. Inlaid with intricate, golden sigils that depict soaring birds of prey.
