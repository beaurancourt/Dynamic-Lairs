# The Whispering Willows

A small (50'x50') Shadowed Sinkhole of evil guarded by a stand of Three (3) _Galdrtré_ in the guise of Weeping Willows standing over a **Stagnant Pond.** Such an act of cruelty has befouled the spring, leaving it stagnant as though her corpse still lies within. Near the pond, to the north-east 30', is a **Coyote Den** which houses Nine (9) Zombified Coyotes (stats as _Zombified Jackals_). Any who wander too close to the pond are _Enthralled_ by the Galdrtré, and made to drown themselves in the pond. (This was the fate of the Coyotes when they made their den too close).

## Stagnant Pond

This is a rank, reedy pool of scummy water, 30' deep. However, it once fed a small creek, and it's dry bed is still visible. At the bottom of the pool are **treasures** surrounding a **corpse** of a girl.

### Treasure

- One (1) Facet Cut Imperial Topaz. 4000 GP
- Three (3) Alexandrites. 500 GP each.
- One (1) Wrought Silver Ring. 700 GP.
- Sword +1, Deathless

(Tokens of a bygone maiden who once admired the spring's tranquility.)

### Corpse

Bloated and rotten past recognition. Dressed as a noble maiden.

(The pond used to be a clear freshwater spring that was the favored bathing spot of the fair daughter of a minor noble. The girl was murdered by a lover, and left in the body of the pond.)

## Coyote Den

This small den, dug into a hillock, is the home of a pack of coyotes who were unfortunate enough to try to drink from the **Stagnant Pond.** In the corner is a **body**, mostly bone, wearing a tattered Mage's cassock.

### Body

- Three (3) Beast Bones: 34 GP each
- Scroll of Magic Warding (on the body)
