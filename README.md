If you already have material that does not follow the below conventions and converting
them would be too troublesome, please upload them anyway and someone will convert them for you!

If uploading them is also a non-starter, feel free to email me at `beau.rancourt@proton.me` and I'll sort it out.

Otherwise! [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the repo and open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) following the structure and style conventions.

# Structure

Each monster has their own folder. Within these folders are `.md` (markdown) files _or_ folders containing `.md` files and other assets (like maps or art).

# Style

Follow the keying style used by Yochai Gal in [Rise of the Blood Olms](https://yochaigal.itch.io/rise-of-the-blood-olms)
